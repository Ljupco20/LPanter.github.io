        <p>We have great attacking players. Our star striker Wilson didn't played as much as he should have in the previous season. He is gonna blossom now in the 2 CF formation, after his first season of adaptaion and with the change of the formation by the manager. Isak has returned to his parent club and will aid his team in the new season, and help lower the goal scoring burden together with Boadu. And let's not forget the tall beast Nsame who came for nearly pennys and played big part in our stride to stay in Division 1.</p>

        <p>We just need 1 more defensive reinforsment for next season and we are solid at the back. Hope we get our main target, the small but great Belguim defender. there are few other younger targets we are also considering, and let's see what happens in the coming transfer window.</p>
